**Important: This repository is intended for educational and portfolio purposes only. It is not meant to be used as a means for completing assignments or projects for the Piscine at 42 Paris or any other educational program by 42.**

Copying code from this repository to use in your own Piscine projects or assignments is strongly discouraged and goes against the ethos of 42. The Piscine is designed to be a challenging learning experience, encouraging problem-solving, creativity, and the development of coding skills through individual effort and teamwork. Using someone else's code doesn't just undermine the integrity of the program but also hinders your own learning and development as a programmer.
